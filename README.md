Interactive visualization comparing SQL databases and vector databases to demonstrate semantic search capabilities.

## Demo

Live Demo

## Features

- Side-by-side comparison of SQL vs Vector database search
- Interactive vector space visualization
- Real-time semantic similarity demonstration
- Educational examples across different domains

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Try different search queries to see how vector databases find semantically similar content

## How It Works

Vector databases convert text into numerical vectors that represent meaning. Similar concepts cluster together in vector space, enabling semantic search that goes beyond exact keyword matching.
